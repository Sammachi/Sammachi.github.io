      <h2>Hobbies & Favorite Activities</h2>
      <p>Two of my absolute favorite hobbies are hiking and art. Growing up in Wisconsin I explored the north woods frequently as a child which eventually led to my interest in hiking and exploring. My absolute favorite hikes include hikes out west in Montana and the Yellowstone region of Wyoming. Although I’m not able to visit as much as I would like, out west is my favorite place to be in the United States. Since I was in elementary school I’ve been filling the pages of my homework and assignments with little doodles. This eventually led into me being a full blown artist and even being able to make money from this passion. I have been creating art for about 11 years now and involve myself in many mediums. I find myself working with pastels, oil paint, clay, pottery, charcoal, and so forth. I am always in awe of the nature and animals around me which is reflected in my artwork. I find it to be such a gift to hold something in my hands that I made myself inspired by the things I enjoy most in life. </p>
