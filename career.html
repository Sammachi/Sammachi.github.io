      <h2>Career Interests</h2>
      <p>Two companies I’d like to explore:</p>

      <section>
        <h3>Microsoft</h3>
        <p><strong>Contact:</strong> Website: microsoft.com, Headquarters: Redmond, WA, Corporate Phone: (425) 882-8080, Careers Page: careers.microsoft.com</p>
        <p><strong>Mission:</strong> To empower every person and organization to achieve more.</p>
        <p><strong>Why:</strong> Microsoft’s mission: to empower every person and organization to achieve more—aligns strongly with my interest in working at a company that blends innovation with meaningful global impact. I’m particularly drawn to Microsoft’s finance and accounting departments because they emphasize cross-functional collaboration, data-driven decision-making, and continuous learning. The opportunity to contribute to large-scale projects while interacting with teams across product, engineering, and strategy excites me. </p>
        <p><strong>Why I'm the Perfect Canidate:</strong> I bring strong organizational skills, leadership experience, and comfort with data-focused tasks. My background working in fast-paced environments has taught me how to problem-solve quickly, manage responsibilities effectively, and communicate clearly—skills that translate directly to corporate finance and accounting roles. My interest in technology and improving workflows also fits well with Microsoft’s emphasis on efficiency and innovation.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>NextEra Energy</h3>
        <p><strong>Contact:</strong> Website: nexteraenergy.com, Headquarters: Juno Beach, FL, Corporate Phone: (561) 694-4000, Careers Page: jobs.nexteraenergy.com</p>
        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Large public energy company with a focus on renewables.</p>
        <p><strong>Why:</strong> NextEra Energy is one of the largest public energy companies in the United States, and its strong commitment to renewable energy makes it especially appealing. I’m interested in sustainability and in understanding how large, complex projects are financed and managed. A role in accounting or project finance at NextEra would give me hands-on experience with real-world energy infrastructure, cost analysis, and long-term financial planning.</p>
        <p><strong>Why I'm the Perfect Canidate:</strong> I have experience being a team leader, managing responsibilities, and staying organized under pressure—skills that translate well to roles that require accuracy and accountability. I’m also passionate about learning, especially when it comes to sustainability, efficient systems, and how large organizations operate at scale.</p>
